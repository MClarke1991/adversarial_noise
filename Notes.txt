Rough plan: 

Find an existing example
Find a good dataset and model
Ensure can get untargeted attack working
Modify to do targeted attack
Test with different classes (note that ImageNet class diff https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/) roughly maps numerical distance to semantic distance
Package and test
Try different models and datasets





Things to add/bonus if there is time: 

Ensure that label names are simple
add comments throughout functions
