Rough plan: 

Find an existing example /
Find a good dataset and model /
Ensure can get untargeted attack working /
Modify to do targeted attack /
Test with different classes (note that ImageNet class diff https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/) roughly maps numerical distance to semantic distance /
Package and test /
Try different models and datasets /


Implementation
Sort out the mix between alpha and epsilon /
remove labels param /
allow user to run from command line image? /


Notes on restrictions:
currently can only transition between classes that are in the standard imagenet classes, and assumes the model used is a resnet that has been trained on imagenet / 



Things to add/bonus if there is time: 

Ensure that label names are simple
add comments throughout functions
write a function to fuzzy match to the class names
Does the model cope with these https://github.com/hendrycks/natural-adv-examples
do not rescale adv image?
early stopping if model converges
fix cropping issue
use conversion to image before testing if the output has converged
